# Configuration

This repository contains a set of sample configurations in [config](/config) directory. There are separate config files for main network, testnet and regression test network.

## Built-in text

Since Blockbook is an open-source project and we don't prevent anybody from running independent instances, it is possible
to alter built-in text. Text fields that could be updated are:

 * [about](/config/text/about) – A note about instance shown on the Application status page and returned by an API.
 * [tos_link](/config/text/tos_link) – A link to Terms of service shown as the footer on the Explorer pages.

A change of these files is meant for a private purposes and PRs that would update them won't be accepted.
